Alexa Skill that gives a simple weather and air quality report based on location, city/state or zip code.

* [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) 
* [Flask-Ask](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask)
* Weather Api from [AirVisual](https://www.airvisual.com)
      

 Simple skill but it let me practise using an api for data, handling permissions from Alexa users and templates for displaying on echo show and dot
