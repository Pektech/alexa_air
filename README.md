## Alexa Air Status

Alexa Skill that gives a simple weather and air quality report based on location, city/state or zip code. 
* [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) 
* [Flask-Ask](https://github.com/johnwheeler/flask-ask)
* Weather Api from [AirVisual](https://www.airvisual.com)
      

 Simple skill but it let me practise using an api for data, handling permissions from Alexa users and templates for displaying on echo show and dot    

[Air Status](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GKZ43J5) is live on Amazon. Currently set for just USA zip codes.
Give it a try and let me know what you think.
